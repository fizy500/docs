## Authentication
For basic usage,this Api takes **1** as the Api key.
By basic usage we mean usage in development or for educational purposes only.
For commercial usage,you will need to pay a one time subscription. 
This Api can be accessed like so: \

` www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1` \

The above url shows the base url calling on the api server and telling the server to return v1(version 1) of the Api and giving it the Api key of **1**
For clarification **1** is the Api key which will be different if you subscribe to our paid plan.
