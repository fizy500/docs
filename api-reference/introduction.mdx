## Free Recipe API Support

The API and site will always remain free at point of access.
If you love our service and want extra features you can sign up as a Paypal supporter.
You can cancel anytime. This allows us to pay for the servers and bandwidth and develop new features.

## Test API Keys
You can use the test API key "1" during development of your app or for educational use (see test links below).
However you must become a supporter if releasing publicly on an appstore.
All data is returned in JSON format. We recomend Json view chrome extension to view the data in your web browser.

## API Production Key Upgrade
All supporters have access to the beta version of the API which allows mutiple ingredient filters.
You also get access to adding your own meals and images. You can also list the full database rather than limited to 100 items.
Please sign up on Paypal and we will email you the upgrade.
